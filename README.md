# This weeks assigment:
- make a to do list
// check repository for further instructions



# My Notes:
- Start by making basic html with elements needed to construct the To-do list. Elements will in this case be: semantic setup(body, header, main and section), div, form, input and button. Accompanied by relevant text.
- Have added some simple css and a background picture.
- Started on the js to manipulate the html, tried to write the code in a manner that I find more organized, but now I don't know if that's why the code doesn't seem to work, will have to do some console logs to see if I can find the point where the code stops functioning. What's odd is that it doesn't give me an error in the  console i dev tool.
