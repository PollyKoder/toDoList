# This weeks assigment:
- make a to do list
// check repository for further instructions



# My Notes:
- Start by making basic html with elements needed to construct the To-do list. Elements will in this case be: semantic setup(body, header, main and section), div, form, input and button. Accompanied by relevant text.
